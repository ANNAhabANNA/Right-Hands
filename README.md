# Right Hands Website for Local Handyman Business
![ami.responsivedesign.is](assets/readme-img/am-i-responsive.jpeg)

This website was created as a first portfolio project for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development. Right Hands Ltd is a real local handyman business that I helped to build its online presence back in 2019 by setting and maintaining its Facebook page and Google My Business. At the time I was not yet skilled to build a well-rounded responsive website in the timeframe set by the business owner. That is why I offered to construct a website by using website builder platform at www.blacknight.com and created required content and imagery. I am excited about being able now to create fully functional website and share my work with fellow coders. 

The website can be found [here](https://annahabanna.github.io/right-hands/index.html).

    ## Design

    * ### Colors

    The website colors were chosen to match the original website [www.righthands.ie](www.righthands.ie) as the business owner was content with its minimalistic color pallette and black-and-white theme with occassional gray. As my offered web design was small-scale and compact accents colors were introduced to make the user experience more memorable and likable. The main accent color of Sun (#EB9532) was picked to mimic the yellow element of hero image with additional accents of Burnt Orange (F2784B) and Cranberry (E94F64) that were mainly used in navigation bar and footer design. The picked accents colors are well accessible with great contrast ratio against the background color of Night Rider (#333333) in navigation bar and footer with the Hawkes Blue(#D6D8DE) as font color.

    The background color of the main section is Hawkes Blue (#D6D8DE) which provides soft and subtle effect for the user eye. The only accent color that had a good accessibility rating against the chosed background color was Burnt Orange (F2784B). Additionally, complimentary font-color Fire Brick (#B22222) was used for continuous accessibility.

    The above color pallette was developed after the first choice of color pallette failed Lighthouse contrast test. The subsequent ideas of color pallette always aimed to improve website experience for visually impaired users.

    * ### Fonts

    The fonts Lora and Source Sans Pro were chosen from available options from Google Fonts database. The Nautigal handwriting font style was added for company name in the footer for more aesthetic look and as an offset to the strict style of the main fonts.

    Source Sans Pro serves as a heading font style and carries over the website minimalistic theme along with tradesman vibe of business.

    Lora compliments the heading font and gives paragraphs a more natural reading rhythm.

    These fonts were picked with user accessibility and readability in mind, with a backup on Sans-Sertif for instances when the main fonts may not be available.
