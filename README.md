# Right Hands Website for Local Handyman Business
![ami.responsivedesign.is](img-readme/am-i-responsive.jpeg)\

This website was created as a first portfolio project for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development. Right Hands Ltd is a real local handyman business that I helped to build its online presence back in 2019 by setting and maintaining its Facebook page and Google My Business. At the time I was not yet skilled to build a well-rounded responsive website in the timeframe set by the business owner. That is why I offered to construct a website by using website builder platform at www.blacknight.com and created required content and imagery. I am excited about being able now to create fully functional website and share my work with fellow coders. 

The website can be found [here](https://annahabanna.github.io/right-hands/index.html).
